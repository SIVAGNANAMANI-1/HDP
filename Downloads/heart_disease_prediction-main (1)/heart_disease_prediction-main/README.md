# Heart Disease Prediction

This Django web application predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data using a machine learning model. Designed to be user-friendly, it provides real-time predictions to help with early diagnosis and better decision-making.

## Why This Model?🤖

We choose the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for the following reasons:


1. Easy to implement and interpret.
   - KNN is straightforward and doesn't require complex parameter tuning.
   
2. Performs well on structured data with relatively small dimensions.
   - It works efficiently with small datasets and structured data, making it a good fit for heart disease prediction.

3. Requires minimal assumptions about data distribution.
   - Unlike some other models, KNN does not make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, making it flexible for various types of datasets.


## Features 🔑
**A list of key functionalities our project provides:**
- User-friendly interface to input health data.
- Real-time predictions powered by a trained KNN model.
- Secure user authentication and admin dashboard.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Framework**: Django 🌐
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn(for KNN model) 🤖
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 💻
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook(used for model development and analysis) 📓

## Machine Learning 📊

This project integrates a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical data. Below are the details of the approach:

### 1. Dataset 📅
TThe model was trained using a dataset that includes various health metrics such as:
- **Chest Pain**
- **Cholesterol levels**
- **Blood pressure**
- **Blood sugar**
- **Heart rate**
- **And more**

These variables are critical for determining heart disease risk, and the model analyzes patterns within the data to make predictions.

### 2. Data Preprocessing 🔧
Before feeding the data into the model, the following steps were performed:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing or incomplete data was either filled in or removed to maintain consistency.
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical features like chest pain type were converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: The data was scaled using StandardScaler to ensure all features were on the same scale, which improves the accuracy of the KNN algorithm.

### 3. Machine Learning Model 🧠
We chose **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** as the machine learning model due to its simplicity and effectiveness in classification problems. KNN works by comparing a new data point to its nearest neighbors and classifying it based on the majority class.

### 4. Training and Testing 📚
The dataset was divided into:
- **Training Set**: 80% of the data was used to train the model.
- **Testing Set**: The remaining 20% was used to test and evaluate the model's accuracy.

### 5. Model Evaluation 🏆
The model's performance was evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: This helped in understanding the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **F1-Score**: This metric balances precision and recall, providing a better measure of performance.

### 6. Libraries Used 📚
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the KNN algorithm and preprocessing the data.
- **Pandas**: Used for handling and processing the dataset.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing the dataset and evaluation metrics.
